# DML_RC_simulations
DML_RC_simulations contains all files to replicate the simulation study in the DML_RC paper.

The zip file (code and results.zip) contains all the Python code used for simulation study, along with the simulation results. To reproduce the simulation results, all shell files (me_C1.sh, me_C2.sh, me_C3.sh, and me_C4.sh) must be submitted to a supercomputer..
Additionally, two R script files (tables for simulation.R and util_results.R) are provided to regenerate Table 2 and Table S1 from the simulation results.
